# List of projects

Here’s a list of projects done by our members, both current and in the past.

## 2017

### VJC Street View

The students wondered if they could help the school reach out to more O Level students by displaying the beautiful VJC campus via 360 photos, using technology similar to Google Street View.


## 2016

### “AirQ” Detector: Haze Detection Device

We noticed that the number of air quality monitoring stations in Singapore is limited to a few locations, and the air quality listed is an average value from various stations and only reported in an hourly basis. We attempted to provide data on-demand by creating and designing a portable, easy-to-use detector. In the process, we learnt about the use of microcontrollers and 3D printing.

In the future, by linking the device with a wireless transmitter, this project could also be scaled up, by using data provided by more people and displaying it on an online haze heatmap. We were lucky to work with SUTD on this project and have benefitted from their guidance and expertise. This project was also presented at the 2016 Singapore Makers’ Faire and submitted for SSEF.


### VJC Blazer Loaning System

We collaborated with VJC’s Students’ Council to tackle a real problem faced by them. One of the councillors highlighted that the school’s blazer loaning system was a tedious and complicated problem for the council as they needed to man the council room to loan blazers and wondered if there was a better way to solve the problem with technology. After discussing and brainstorming with the SC to decide on the features required, we designed a [website](https://vjcblazer.appspot.com/) which allows students to conveniently borrow and return the blazers. Unfortunately, the solution was not implemented as the blazers were passed over to the general office staff to handle.


### 3D-printed Gifts for VJC guests

VJC wanted to provide special gifts for the VVIP of VJC, and decided to collaborate with us on a 3D-printing project. Jared Goh from 16S44 volunteered to do this project. He started out by conceptualizing various ideas and eventually settled on the idea of making the school crest in 3D. He challenged the norms and innovated further by making a rotatable school crest design. Jared separated the school crest into individual elements (the ring, shield, flame, book and name), to allow each element to freely rotate around a central axis.

Through a few weeks of Prototyping, Printing and Redesigning, a first workable product was created. After a few more weeks of trials and improvement, we finally presented the final product to VJC.


### Coffee Maker made with Recycled Lightbulbs

We collaborated with Earth Watch to help to think of ways to up-recycle old electronic products. After brainstorming over many ideas, we settled on using old lightbulbs to up-recycle into coffee makers. Although forewarned of possible difficulties, we still continued with the project and forged ahead in designing a suitable prototype. Eventually, together with Earthwatch, we participated in the Environmental Arts Fiesta 2016 and showcased our product.


### Home Automation

We wanted to help teachers tackle the problem when teachers are carrying many things and are not able to scan their fingers to enter the staffroom. The project then evolved to consider home automation as a possible application. The project was ambitious as it required multiple areas of knowledge from Circuitry, to RFIDs to rewiring antennas. The team made a good attempt and learnt many skills like soldering and impedance matching along the way.


### 3D-printed Phone Covers

We were interested in 3D printing and in designing a phone cover. Even though our team previously had no experience with 3D printing, we picked up the skills required initially through the workshop and later on through their own research on line.


### 3D-printed Glider

We were interested in building a glider, and also learn more about the physics of flight at the same time. 3D printing was a good avenue for us to rapidly prototype, fail, learn from our mistakes and remake our prototype. We also learnt to consider the properties of materials and how to assemble them properly.
