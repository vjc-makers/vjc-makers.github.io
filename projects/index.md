# List of projects

Here’s a list of projects done by our members, both current and in the past.

## 2017

### VJC Street View

The students wondered if they could help the school reach out to more O levels students but displaying the beautiful VJC campus via 360 photos, using technology similar to google street view.


## 2016

### “AirQ” Detector: Haze Detection Device

We noticed that the number of air quality monitoring stations in Singapore is limited to a few locations, and the air quality listed is an average value from various stations and only reported in an hourly basis. We attempted to provide data on-demand by creating and designing a portable, easy-to-use detector. In the process, we learnt about the use of microcontrollers and 3D printing.

In the future, by linking the device with a wireless transmitter, this project could also be scaled up, by using data provided by more people and displaying it on an online haze heatmap. We were lucky to work with SUTD on this project and have benefitted from their guidance and expertise. This project was also presented at the 2016 Singapore Makers’ Faire and submitted for SSEF.


### VJC Blazer Loaning System

They then started out tackling a real problem which they learned about from the Student’s Council of VJC. One of the councillors highlighted that Blazer Loaning system is a tedious problem for the council as they needed to man the council room to loan blazers and wondered if there was a better way to solve the problem with technology. This group immediately sprang into action and designed a working website that allows students to borrow and return the blazers. Unfortunately, the solution was not implemented as the blazers were passed over to the general office staff to handle.


### 3D-printed Gifts for VJC guests

VJC wanted to provide special gifts for the VVIP of VJC, and decided to collaborate with Project: Makers on a 3D-printing project. Jared Goh from 16S44 volunteered to do this project. He started out conceptualizing various ideas but settled on the idea of making the school crest in 3D. He challenged the norms further and innovated further by having a rotatable school crest design.

Through a few weeks of Prototyping, Printing and Redesigning, a first workable product was created.
 
Jared separated the school crest into individual elements (the ring, shield, flame, book and name), and each element is able to freely rotate around a central axis. But as can be seen, these are still parts connected by a Satay stick, done in the spirit of rapid prototyping. After a few more weeks of trials and improvement, we presented the final product.


### Collaboration with Earth Watch for Coffee Maker by up-recycling old bulbs.

We collaborated with Earth Watch to help to think of ways to up-recycle old electronic products. After brainstorming over many ideas, we settled on using old lightbulbs to up-recycle into coffee makers. Although forewarned of possible difficulties, the team showed their resilience and forged ahead. Eventually, together with Earthwatch, the team participated in the Environmental Arts Fiesta 2016 and showcased their product.


### 3D-printed Phone Covers

We were interested in 3D printing and in designing a phone cover. Even though they previously had no experience with 3D printing, they picked up the skills required initially through the workshop and later on through their own research on line.


### 3D-printed Glider

We were interested in building a glider, and also learn more about the physics of flight at the same time. 3D printing was a good avenue for us to rapidly prototype, fail, learn from our mistakes and remake our prototype. We also learnt to consider the properties of materials and how to assemble them properly.


### Home Automation

We wanted to help teachers tackle the problem when teachers are carrying many things and are not able to scan their fingers to enter the staffroom. The project then evolved to consider home automation as a possible application. The project was ambitious as it required multiple areas of knowledge from Circuitry, to RFIDs to rewiring antennas. The team made a good attempt and learnt many skills like soldering and impedance matching along the way.
